# 2DGameEngine
Simple 2D game engine that uses SDL, GLM, Dear ImGUI and Lua, based on an online course

## Main Features
* Entity-Component-Sytem architecture
* Event system
* Test suite (this is an extra effort I am doing to practice testing software) 

## Things to Improve:
- [ ] Visibility of arguments when adding a component - Right now the way to show the arguments when adding a component is by either going to that component's file or by hovering over the component type which displays its arguments information. This info needs to be added manually and when we want to change the default value of a parameter we need to update it in 2 places. Ideally updating the default value would update the text that displays it, and there would be a better way to show the programmer what the arguments for that component are.
